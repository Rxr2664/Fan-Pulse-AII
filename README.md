🏟️ FanPulse AI

Agentic fan engagement intelligence for sports teams

✨ About FanPulse AI

FanPulse AI is an agentic, AI-powered assistant built to help sports teams deeply understand their fans and improve the game-day experience.

Inspired by a simple but powerful question — “What do fans actually want?” — FanPulse AI turns scattered fan feedback and operational data into clear, actionable insights. Instead of digging through surveys or dashboards, team owners can ask natural-language questions and get instant, data-backed answers.

Built for the IBM AI Experiential Learning Lab – Sports Industry Challenge, FanPulse AI addresses Challenge 1: Deepening Fan Engagement.

🎯 What FanPulse AI Does

FanPulse AI allows team owners and executives to ask questions like:

How satisfied are fans with the stadium experience?

What can I do better as an owner?

How far do fans commute and how do they get to games?

Are food, drinks, and parking priced fairly?

Which fans are at risk of not renewing season tickets?

How do fans react during wins, losses, or major trades?

The assistant responds with clear explanations, visual insights, and patterns pulled directly from the data.

🧠 Agentic AI Workflow

FanPulse AI follows an agentic design pattern:
